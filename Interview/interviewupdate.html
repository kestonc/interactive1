       		<p class="pop">What is ‘good’ screen-based design?</p>
       		
       	<p>
       		A good screen-based design is minimalistic. Also, there shall always be a hierarchy that will support the users experience. It’s clean and readable, not cluttered. It can be on a grid like how print works, but it goes beyond that thinking incomes with screen-based because it can go virtually, it can be 3D or 4D, it’s up to the designer to create an interesting idea.

   			<p class="pop">How is art making online different then art making offline?</p>
   			<p>
   			Art making online is more interactive with the use of internet. It can have critiques as soon as your post it online. You don’t have to carry it or print it in order to get some feedbacks. It has the advantage of being fast-paced and a disadvantage of being lazy to design articulately. Being online can be an effect of the so called “revisions” where before, you have one or few chances to edit it.

   			<p class="pop">What do you think is the ‘purpose(s)’ of the web?</p>
   
   		<p>
   			To connect with people all around the globe. It is a means of communication that combines text and images and place it in the screen. It is also a medium to share thoughts and experiences, achievements and status. (also includes file sharing, picture and videos). A method in which you are able to do do it fast. Purposely, the web is basically another reality where people can be anyone (reference: geocities reading).
